# Automating Cyber Threat Intelligence: Tracking and Visualizing Adversary TTPs

*Because cyber threats don‚Äôt take coffee breaks, but you can.*

# Overview

This project is a prototype Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform that automates the extraction of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from unstructured threat reports, maps them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and presents the results through interactive visualizations.

The system combines SecureBERT + TRAM-based multi-label classification with rule-based extraction methods, malware‚ÄìTTP linking, and temporal event detection. Results are displayed in a web-based interface for analysts, security teams, and researchers.

# Features

* NLP-based TTP Extraction from CTI reports, blogs, and other text sources.

* MITRE ATT&CK Mapping of tactics and techniques.

* Malware‚ÄìTTP Association based on MITRE CTI data.

* Real-Time Processing via a Flask-based web frontend.

* User Feedback Integration to improve usability and clarity.

Interactive Visualizations:

* Heatmaps

* Attack Timelines

* MITRE ATT&CK Matrix

* Malware‚ÄìTTP Relationship Graphs


# No Install. No Setup. No Tears.
Seriously, there are no prerequisites. You don‚Äôt need Python, pip, or to sacrifice a goat to the AI gods.
All you have to do is click the link here: https://styx8114-mess-managed.hf.space/ and boom. 

# How It Works: 

1. Click ‚ÄúHacker Shenanigans‚Äù ‚Äì because we take naming things very seriously.

2. Upload a cybersecurity PDF report ‚Äì APT case studies, threat intel writeups, or that random ‚ÄúConfidential.pdf‚Äù you found on your desktop *(no, please don't upload your "Confidential" stuff - I am not responsible for that üôå)*

3. Sit back while the AI + MITRE ATT&CK wizardry happens: TTP extraction, malware mapping, timeline generation‚Ä¶ all without you lifting a finger.

4. Enjoy your results:

* Visualizations ‚Äì Heatmaps, timelines, knowledge graphs

* MITRE Mapping ‚Äì TTPs, malware families, techniques neatly lined up

5. Bask in the glow of work you didn‚Äôt have to manually do.




# Future Enhancements

* Batch processing of multiple reports in parallel.

* Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) integration.

* Higher F1-scores via hybrid NLP architectures.

* Enhanced mobile-friendly UI.




# Final Note

This platform saves you from scrolling through endless PDFs so you can focus on more important things: like memes, coffee, and pretending to patch that server you‚Äôve been ignoring for two weeks.
If you actually enjoy reading CTI reports cover-to-cover, in that case *carry on*
